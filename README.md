This project is a weather application that utilizes the Weather API to fetch and display current weather conditions for specified cities. The application aims to provide a user-friendly interface to easily access weather information.

## Current Features
- **Temperature Display**: Users can currently get the current temperature for a specified city.
- **Country Name Display**: Users can also see the country name associated with the specified city.

## Future Plans
I am actively working on this project and plan to add more features in the future, including:
- Detailed weather information (humidity, wind speed, precipitation, etc.)
- Hourly and 7-day weather forecasts
- Improved UI/UX design for better user experience
- User authentication for saving favorite locations
- A full website to enhance functionality and accessibility
